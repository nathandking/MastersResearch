This folder contains different applications of the level set method.

LSHeatCircle: My first implementation of the heat equation on a circle with the level set method.

LSHeat: My implementations of the heat equation defined on different surfaces with the level set method. These implementations use some functions in cp_matrices for interpolation, plotting and defining the level set function.

LSTextureMapping: My first implementation of the manifold mapping problem with the level set method. Visualization of the map is done by seeing how a texture mapped to the surface changes.  These implementations use some functions in cp_matrices for interpolation, plotting and defining the level set function.
