This folder contains different applications of the closest point method.

CPHeatCircle: My first implementation of the heat equation on a circle with the closest method.

CPHeat: Implementations of the heat equation defined on different surfaces with the closest point  method. These implementations were done by Steve Ruuth and Colin Macdonald.

CPTextureMapping: Implemation of manifold mapping with the closest point method. The texture mapping application similar to the level set manifold mapping code is explored.
